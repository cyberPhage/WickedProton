# WickedProton
Simple proton mail brute force program written in python 
Unlike usual brute forcing tools, this is gui instead of only terminal so that you can explicitly see
 the processing speed and how fast the server responds AND ACCORDINGLY SET THE DELAY AFTER EACH LOGIN . As most sites including this one use ajax a little delay of 
 few centiseconds is always recommended although the least required delay may vary depending on your network connection and the speed of the server while it checks the login credentials .
